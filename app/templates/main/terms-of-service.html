      <p>From this site, you may download the information and use it on your computer for personal study or other non-commercial purposes. You must include appropriate attribution/credit on the material you extract. In this case, free means free.  It cannot be bundled with anything sold, nor can you charge for shipping, handling, or anything.

      <h4 id="2conductrestrictions">2. Conduct Restrictions</h4>

      <p>While using BhagavadGita.io, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;</li>

      <li>attempt to disrupt or tamper with BhagavadGita.io's servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on BhagavadGita.io's servers through automated means, or to access BhagavadGita.io's Service in ways that exceed your authorization.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="3scraping">3. Scraping</h4>

      <p>Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through Bhagavad Gita API. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from BhagavadGita.io for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.</li>

      <li>Archivists may scrape BhagavadGita.io for public data for archival purposes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You may not scrape BhagavadGita.io for spamming purposes.</p>

      <h4 id="4excessivebandwidthuse">4. Excessive Bandwidth Use</h4>

      <p>If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other Bhagavad Gita customers, we reserve the right to suspend your account until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.</p>

      <h3 id="apiterms">API Terms</h3>

      <h4 id="noabuseoroveruseoftheapi">No Abuse or Overuse of the API</h4>

      <p>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to BhagavadGita.io via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. BhagavadGita.io, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.</p>

      <p>You may not share API tokens to exceed BhagavadGita.io's rate limitations.</p>

      <p>You may not use the API to download data or Content from BhagavadGita.io for spamming purposes.</p>

      <p>BhagavadGita.io may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of BhagavadGita.io Service.</p>

      <p>Using the Bhagavad Gita API, you may download the information and use it in your app or website as long as you do not charge for it. You must include appropriate attribution/credit on the material you extract. In this case, free means free.
