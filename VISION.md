# Vision

This document serves to outline the long term goals of `The Gita Initiative` and act as a guidance when making decisions about features and issues.

## Prioritizing Features & Fixes

`The Gita Initiative` is a not-for-profit initiative to help spread the transcendental wisdom from the Bhagavad Gita to people around the world.

## Goals & Scope

The core goal of `The Gita Initiative` is to build fast, stable, and user friendly web and mobile apps to spread the knowledge of Bhagavad Gita to the people around the world.

## Collaboration & Community

`The Gita Initiative` is an open-source project which means everyone in the community is as much of an owner and is responsible for it. We welcome everyone to become a collaborator on the project with whatever level of contribution you feel comfortable with.

We recognize that maintaining open source projects can be demanding, and often done in addition to other responsibilities. We have no expectation for the amount or frequency of contribution from anyone.

We also ask that you help keep our community welcoming and open.

## Communication

GitHub Issues and our Slack workspace serve as the "source of truth" for all communication and decision-making about `The Gita Initiative`. This keeps everything open and centralized.
